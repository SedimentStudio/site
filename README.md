# Sediment Site

Built with Gatsby and Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸš€ Development

1.  **Start developing.**
Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```shell
cd site
yarn develop
```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

Open the `site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

yarn build
```
